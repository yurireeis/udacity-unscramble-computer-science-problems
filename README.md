# Unscramble Computer Science Problems (Investigating Texts and Calls challenge)

## Project Overview

In this project, you will complete five tasks based on a fabricated set of calls and texts exchanged during September 2016. You will use Python to analyze and answer questions about the texts and calls contained in the dataset. Lastly, you will perform run time analysis of your solution and determine its efficiency.

## Setup

To get the best of compatibility, I would recommend using [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html) with Python in version 3.9

### Creating environment

```
virtualenv venv --python=python3.9
```

### Activate environment

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Deactivate environment

```
deactivate
```
